# Python GUI Guessing Game
## Objective
The Python GUI Guessing Game is intended to demonsrate programming use case methodology. This project includes the following steps: Summary and Customer Request, Analysis, Pseudocode Design, and Testing. This hands-on experience aim to establish Python programming variables, statements, and arguments techniques in an impactful manner (interactive GUI).

### Skills Learned
-Proficiency in  Python programming variables, statements, and arguments techniques
-Exercise critical thinking to address customer use cases into an object oriented language
-Convey use case into pseudocode for better visualization of code
-Familiarization with Python modules (import random)
-Familiarization with Python for potential malicious use
  
### Tools Used
-Python 3.2
-Geany Compiler

## Steps

### Summary and Customer Request
### Analysis
